# To extract and count the seq inside the pack
# just extract them as zip file and then 
# concatenate them. Once concatenated just 
# extract each line marked with ">" icon 
# and count the number of the resulting lines.



// extract 
unzip "filename"

//concatenate the files 
cat filename1 filename2 filename 3 ..... filenameN > cat_output.txt

//extract the lines and count them 
grep \> cat_output.txt | wc -l > number_of_lines.txt


// Inside the "number_of_lines" file there will be a number 
// that represent the number of total seq present in the 
// whole pack that we download.



//Example :

unzip fasta.bos_taurus.*
cat fasta.bos_taurus.* > fasta.cat_bos_taurus.txt
grep \> fasta.cat_bos_taurus.txt | wc -l > number_fasta_seq_bos_taurus.txt
